# QuickMaths

An attempt at building a fast mathematical computation library using WASM. 

## Lesson Learned

Wasm is expensive to call and suffers under load. I'd love to find a way around this. 

I've committed this code as a cautionary tale. 

`dist` is also committed to get a full snapshot of the experiment.
